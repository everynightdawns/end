	"description": "Golden Tiger Eclipse, Jade Hare Prosperity is the 2023 edition of Li Xi: an [Endproject](https://endproject.xn--mk1bu44c) endeavor.  \n  \nThe Tiger traversed thousands of miles of white snow.  \nThe green hills are not old; the beauty is still in the Moon.  \nHe drinks up the past and lays to sleep.  \n  \nThe Jade Rabbit comes to repay your blessing with the Sound of Heart.  \nThe Rabbit became white and white again; the hills clear for the Rabbit to roam.  \nThere are flowers in your heart and sunshine tomorrow.  \nJoys and sorrows illuminate all yearning, hear the echo from the road ahead.  \n  \nThe future is like the sea; the future is long.  \nA year's plan starts with Spring.  \n  \nMay your dreams always shine in the long night, all wishes come true.",
